## About me
[[ange123ux](https://github.com/ange123ux/delani-studio.git)]
I consider myself as someone who is lucky because I grew up in a family where I am the first person to take programming classes. Currently, I am a student in Southern New Hampshire University and I am doing Communications in Business. Having a Software Developer degree will be an added advantage to my career, and I can't wait to make that big step in my life.
